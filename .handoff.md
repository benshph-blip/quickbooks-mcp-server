### Analysis In Progress: VetSuite Partnership Evaluation

**Goal:** Determine if Highland can hit 80% Covetrus distribution threshold for $46K rebate

**Critical Finding:** "Bill" entity only has data through June 2024, but **Purchase** entity has current data (Jan 2026). Must use Purchase for 2025 analysis.

**Vendor IDs:**
- Covetrus (Henry Schein Animal Health): ID 135
- Covetrus (Phoenix Pharmacy): ID 1961
- MWI Veterinary Supply: ID 1180
- Patterson Veterinary: ID 1996

**Historical Data (all-time Bills through June 2024):**
- Covetrus: $523,867 (32%)
- MWI: $1,111,508 (68%)
- Current share: 32% (need 80%)

### Next Steps
1. Query 2025 **Purchase** transactions (not Bills) for Covetrus and MWI:
```sql
SELECT TotalAmt, TxnDate, EntityRef FROM Purchase WHERE EntityRef = '135' AND TxnDate >= '2025-01-01' MAXRESULTS 1000
SELECT TotalAmt, TxnDate, EntityRef FROM Purchase WHERE EntityRef = '1180' AND TxnDate >= '2025-01-01' MAXRESULTS 1000
```

2. Calculate current 2025 Covetrus percentage from Purchase data

3. Report findings - can Highland realistically hit 80%?

### Original Context
- Dr. Torry (Steffen) asked about VetSuite Partnership Program
- $4,250 rebate per DVM x 11 DVMs = $46,750/year potential rebate
- Requires 80% distribution purchases through Covetrus
- User believed they could "easily hit all the numbers" - historical data shows only 32%
- Need current 2025 data to give accurate assessment

### MCP Config (in ~/.mcp.json)
```json
"quickbooks": {
  "command": "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/bin/python3",
  "args": ["/Users/benjaminsterrett/Projects/quickbooks-mcp/main_quickbooks_mcp.py"],
  "cwd": "/Users/benjaminsterrett/Projects/quickbooks-mcp"
